# Mesto

[Mesto](https://bofeof.nomoredomains.club) is a type of Instagram prototype.  
If https://bofeof.nomoredomains.club (hosting probably expired) is not available you can also check another deployment [Mesto frontend](https://bofeof.github.io/react-mesto-auth) or run Mesto locally.

This project includes [frontend](https://github.com/bofeof/react-mesto-auth) and [backend](https://github.com/bofeof/express-mesto-gha) parts and it's deployed and developed to practice programming skills.

Demo [Demo of Mesto](https://github.com/bofeof/react-mesto-api-full/issues/5)

If you want to create a new user, please, use fake email(for example test@test.com)

## Available functionality runs through the server:

### Standard functionality for users:

- Working with popups to change user avatar, name and bio sections;
- Create new photocards;
- Zoom photocards;
- Toggle like;
- Remove card and confirmation window for this action;
- Login and register with fail or successfull-info popup;
- Available screen width for this app: from 320px to 1280px.

### Additional features for users I hope to implement in the future:

✅ Forms validator: avatar, user, add card, login and register;  
✅ Submit-buttons control for all forms;  
✅ Close all popups by Esc-button and clicking overlay;  
✅ Classic and burger menu, it depends on screen width:

- burger menu (width < 768px);
- classic menu (width > 768px).

✅ 404 page and button for redirection if something is wrong (with multiple slashes).  
✅ JWT in cookie
