# Mesto

[Mesto](https://bofeof.nomoredomains.club) is a type of Instagram prototype.  
If https://bofeof.nomoredomains.club (hosting probably expired) is not available you can also check another deployment [Mesto frontend](https://bofeof.github.io/react-mesto-auth) or run Mesto locally.

This project includes [frontend](https://github.com/bofeof/react-mesto-auth) and [backend](https://github.com/bofeof/express-mesto-gha) parts and it's deployed and developed to practice programming skills.
